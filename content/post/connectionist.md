A foreword on the word "conscious": I use this word only in the context of "the conscious brain" which I use interchangeably with "the accessible brain". By this I mean the part I have access to. For example, I have access to my internal voice, to feeling in my toes, to random fleeting memories, to music stuck in my head. I don't have access to the "unconscious" or "inaccessible" brain, i.e. the transmission of signals along my spinal cord, the firing of my neurons, and much more.

## A model of the brain
One can think of the brain as a large collection the inaccessible machinery combined with a small window of accessible area. I imagine the mind like the Chinese Room, except instead of a dictionary, the man has a huge collection of bits and tools. Schmidhuber might say that there's an unconcious adaptive compreessor that provides most of our motivations. Even if not, I'm more certain that the retreival process is mostly unconcious
