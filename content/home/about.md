## Greetings!

I am a 3rd year undergrad studying Statistics at The Wharton School and Computer Science at Penn Engineering.

> "My main goal is to build a machine smarter then myself, then retire."  - [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/)

I have focused my studies and research in **machine learning** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on combining parse-based and neural approaches. A collection of my ideas on these topics will appear below.

My favorite recent paper is [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf), for using ML in an application I had never considered applicable. My all time favorite paper is, again from Schmidhuber, is his [Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun,
and Intrinsic Motivation](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ieeecreative.pdf).
